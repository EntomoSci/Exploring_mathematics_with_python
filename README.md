# Exploring mathematics with Python
###### A exploration of mathematics writing python programs without using prebuilt math functions.

---

## What is this?
In this repository I will explore mathematics from basic to advanced concepts using the Python programming language. Here you are able to see some math related Python programs without using prebuilt math functions. The final objective of a program here is to be written each time with less abstraction, so if you see in the code a `import math`, is only temporaly code.
The programs are basic terminal-oriented tools that lack a GUI (for now).

## How to use
- Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) (if you don't have it) with the "*add to path*" installer checkbox selected.
- Download this repository or the specific program in what you are interested.
- Open a terminal sesion and travel where the downloaded files are located.
- Execute the file **main.py** file with the commands `python3 main.py` for Linux/Mac or `py main.py` for Windows.
- Follow the steps displayed by the program.
- Enjoy!
